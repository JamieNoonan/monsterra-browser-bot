### Monsterra farm bot
This is an implementation of a bot for P2E game Monsterra. Currently bot can automate battles and daily quests. Written in .NET Framework. `Works with liteplay.monsterra.io browser window version only!`

![alt text](https://github.com/JamieNoonan/monsterra-browser-bot/blob/main/beta.png?raw=true)

### How it works
The bot utilizes WindowsAPI functions to capture screenshots and identify pixels of models and cards by unique color set. After that bot emulates mouse clicks by valid pixels coordinates. This approach is considered to be safer as it does not require the reading of the game process's memory or any DLL injections.

### Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher

### Setup
1. Go to `liteplay.monsterra.io`, login and set browser window resolution to full-screen (F11 key)
2. [Download](https://github.com/JamieNoonan/monsterra-browser-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) repository release and extract files with password `m0nsterra`
3. Launch bot with correct settings

### Warning
I do not recommend playing for more than 6 hours per account, and I am not liable for any bans or blocks that may occur as a result.
